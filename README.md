I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/) at [Iowa State University (ISU)](https://www.iastate.edu/).  I received my B.Sc. and M.Phil. in [Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/) from [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/).

My research interest is forensic statistics and statistical inference for incomplete data.
